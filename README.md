# Introduction
Predicting football match results is a challenging and widely studied problem due to the complexity and unpredictability of the sport. Leveraging historical match data, predictive models aim to determine outcomes—home win, draw, or away win—providing valuable insights into
team performance and match dynamics. Despite advance-ments in machine learning, the current golden standard for accuracy remains modest at approximately 53%. This report focuses on the English Premier League (EPL), one of the most competitive football leagues globally, us-
ing historical in-match data encompassing performance metrics and team trends. We propose a novel approach to improve predictive accuracy through innovations in feature
engineering, feature selection, and model architectures. Avoting ensemble of seven excelled models was developed, achieving baseline results near the golden standard and
surpassing it with an upper accuracy exceeding 55%. By introducing 105 systematically engineered features and re-
fining selection techniques, we offered a fresh perspective and significant contributions to football match prediction.
